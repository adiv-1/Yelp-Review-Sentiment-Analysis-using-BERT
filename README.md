# Yelp-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-using-BERT

### Utilizing the BERT model from the transformers library to perform sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews, extracting and classifying the sentiment of each review on a scale of 1 to 5.

In this mini-project, I developed a sentiment analysis tool using a pre-trained BERT model from the transformers library. I collected reviews from a Yelp business page using web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup. The text data was processed and fed into the BERT model to classify the sentiment of each review on a scale from 1 to 5. The sentiment scores were then aggregated to provide an overall sentiment rating for the business. The entire process, from data collection to sentiment analysis, was implemented in a Jupyter notebook.
